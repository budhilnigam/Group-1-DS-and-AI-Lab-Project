# **Objectives of the Project**

The objectives of this project are:

* To design a RAG-based LLM system capable of generating grounded review comments for single-file Python pull request diffs containing up to 200 modified lines.

* To retrieve relevant project-specific information such as coding standards, documentation, and past accepted review discussions during the review process.

* To compare review comments generated by:  
  * a baseline LLM without retrieval, and  
  * the proposed RAG-based system.

* To measure:  
  * issue detection accuracy,  
  * hallucination rate based on unsupported or inapplicable guideline references,  
  * semantic agreement with human review comments as a supporting analysis metric.

* To evaluate usability of generated suggestions through issue-level precision and simulated suggestion acceptance rate.

* To record latency overhead introduced by the retrieval component during inference.

* To deploy a prototype interface capable of generating automated review comments for Python pull request diffs.
